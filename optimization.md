# ScopeLock — Optimization Tracker

Code review findings, status, and rationale for each change.

## Refactor Safety

All structural changes (App.tsx extraction, CSS splitting) must be done with the current test suite in place and passing. The agreement generator and PDF payload tests are not optional — they are the regression guardrail for document output during refactors. Do not begin structural work without running `npm test` first and keeping it green throughout.

## Done

### Tests — agreement generator + PDF payload contract
**Files:** `src/lib/__tests__/agreement-generator.test.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/pdf-payload.test.ts`
**Coverage:** 74 tests across both files; 0 failures (includes invoice HTML escaping in `pdf-payload.test.ts`).

The agreement generator is core product IP. It conditionally includes/omits legal sections (exclusions, warranty, dispute resolution, change orders, hidden damage) based on job data. A silent regression here — a section appearing when it shouldn't, or vice versa — produces a broken legal document. That is expensive to catch after the fact, especially once clients are signing things.

The PDF payload tests protect the contract between the client and `/api/pdf`. As e-sign and payment flows are added, the payload shape will be touched. These tests will catch drift before it reaches production.

These tests validate behavior, not implementation, ensuring refactors to UI or data flow cannot silently alter document output.

Vitest was added as a dev dependency. `vite.config.ts` uses `import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'` so the `test: { environment: 'node' }` block type-checks under `tsc -b`. `App.css?raw` is stubbed via `vi.mock` in the payload test file (Vite's raw suffix isn't available in the Node runner).

### App.tsx — navigation, auth/profile, grouped flow state
**Files:** `src/hooks/useAppNavigation.ts` (~61 lines), `src/hooks/useAuthProfile.ts` (~189 lines), `src/App.tsx` (~672 lines; previously ~784)

`useAppNavigation` owns `view`, `pushState`/`popstate`, `navigateTo`, and `replaceView` (used after PDF capture and on auth success). `useAuthProfile` wraps `useAuth`, profile fetch/`loadProfile`/`setProfile`, and post-capture `sessionStorage` + `visibilitychange` redirect; it receives `replaceView` and `setWorkOrdersSuccessBanner` from App so redirects stay consistent. Invoice flow, change-order flow, and draft state (job, unsaved modal, WO counter persist error) are grouped into object `useState` values in App. The full view-switching JSX remains in `App.tsx`.

### CSS split — `App.css` + co-located component sheets
**Files:** `src/App.css` (~1,858 lines at completion); thirteen `src/components/*.css` files imported only from their owning components.

**Rules:** `App.tsx` still imports `App.css` alone (load order). `App.css?raw` for PDFs is unchanged. Global tokens, app shell, shared primitives (e.g. payment-method chips, work-order row list chrome, `invoice-final-nav` / headings shared with detail pages), agreement/invoice **document** and `@media print` blocks stay in `App.css`.

**Payoff:** Page/feature styles live beside the component that owns them; global/PDF surface stays one file for Puppeteer and shared chrome.

### HTML escape utility — shared `esc()`
**Files:** `src/lib/html-escape.ts` (single `esc()`); consumers `agreement-sections-html.ts`, `change-order-generator.ts`, `invoice-generator.ts`. **Tests:** `pdf-payload.test.ts` covers agreement sections, change orders, and invoice HTML escaping.

One source of truth for `&`, `<`, `>`, `"`, `'` entity encoding in generated document HTML; newline→`<br />` remains after escape in CO/invoice notes where it already did.

## Not Doing / Already Done

### README accuracy
The original critique flagged a mismatch where the README described ScopeLock as a static app with no backend. **This is already fixed.** The current README correctly describes the Node server requirement, Chrome/Puppeteer dependency, Supabase auth/DB, and deployment expectations. ARCHITECTURE.md and CLAUDE.md are also accurate. No action needed.
